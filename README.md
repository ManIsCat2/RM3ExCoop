# RM3ExCoop

Modification of RM2ExCoop to fix or add or remove some things, these include:
- WIP Intensity texture exporting
- Bruteforce rip script.c EVEN if the level model fails
- Removed "Model Optimization" because it broke some romhacks
- Handle Fast3d Unknown commands with a No-Op instead of a error
- Pressing C2ExCoop now actually fixes actors aswell. (renames every "custom." and adds texture.inc.c to model.inc.c)
- Not exporting actors that are broken, we just tell the user that it's broken
